Wordpress Link Preview Plugin


The purpose of this plugin is to create Facebook style links in Wordpress posts.

The idea of placing this code on github is so that someone can work on it to improve it.

As it is I have enough time to get something working to use on my site and that's about it.

A fair amount of the code used here is derived from other projects.

The main sources of code will be detailed in this readme file.


1) Link preview

I use code from this public domain project to get information and the image.
This uses the php classes

2) Wordpress plugin
